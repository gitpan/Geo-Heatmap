NAME
    Geo::Heatmap - generate a density map (aka heatmap) overlay layer for
    Google Maps, see the www directory in the distro how it works

    see the script directory for creating a scale

    for a real life example see

REQUIRES
      Moose
      CHI
      Imager

METHODS
  tile
      tile();

      return the tile image in png format

ATTRIBUTES
      debug
      cache
      logfile
      return_points
      zoom_scale
      palette

  USAGE
    Create a Heatmap layer for GoogleMaps

   The HTML part
   The (f)cgi part
    You need a color palette (one is included) to encode values to colors,
    in Storable Format as an arrayref of arrayrefs eg

        [50] = [34, 45, 56]

    which means that a normalized value of 50 would lead to an RGB color of
    34% red , 45% blue, 56% green.

    zoom_scale
        The maximum number of points for a given google zoom scale. You
        would be able to extract to values from the denisity log or derive
        them from your data in some cunning way

    cache
        You need some caching for the tiles otherwise the map would be quite
        slow. Use a CHI object with the cache you like

    return_points
        A function reference which expects a single hashref as a parameter
        which defines two LAT/LONG points to get all data points within this
        box:

              $r->{LATN}, $r->{LNGW}), $r->{LATS}, $r->{LNGE}

        The function has to return an arrayref of arrayrefs of the points
        within the box

    tile
        Returns the rendered image
