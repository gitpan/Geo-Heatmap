NAME
    Geo::Heatmap - generate a density map (aka heatmap) overlay layer for
    Google Maps, see the www directory in the distro how it works

VERSION
    version 0.15

REQUIRES
    You need a color palette (one is included) to encode values to colors,
    in Storable Format as an arrayref of arrayrefs eg

        [50] = [34, 45, 56]

    which means that a normalized value of 50 would lead to an RGB color of
    34% red , 45% blue, 56% green.

    zoom_scale
        The maximum number of points for a given google zoom scale. You
        would be able to extract to values from the denisity log or derive
        them from your data in some cunning way

    cache
        You need some caching for the tiles otherwise the map would be quite
        slow. Use a CHI object with the cache you like

    return_points
        A function reference which expects a single hashref as a parameter
        which defines two LAT/LONG points to get all data points within this
        box:

              $r->{LATN}, $r->{LNGW}), $r->{LATS}, $r->{LNGE}

        The function has to return an arrayref of arrayrefs of the points
        within the box

    tile
        Returns the rendered image
